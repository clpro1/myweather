== README

This site is pretty simple to setup - it's currently running as follows:

* Ruby 2.x
* Rails 4.2.x
* CentOS 6.5
* MySQL 5.x
* jQuery 1.12.1
* Phusion Passenger
* You'll need a Google geocode API key and Forecast.io API key.  Both are free up to a certain number of calls per day.
* You'll also need two records in the database - one for the Forecast API info, and one for the Google info.  The info may change in the future but currently it looks like this:
- Google Information:
  - url:  https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?
  - requests per day: 2500
  - service name in the db: google (all lowercase)
- Forecast Information:
  - url:  https://api.forecast.io/forecast/
  - requests per day: 1000
  - service name in the db: forecast (all lowercase)
